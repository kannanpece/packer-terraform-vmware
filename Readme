Layer 3 attacks and layer 4 attacks detailed list pls


ChatGPT
Certainly! Layer 3 and Layer 4 attacks refer to specific types of network attacks that target different layers of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. Here's a detailed list of Layer 3 and Layer 4 attacks:

Layer 3 Attacks (Network Layer):

IP Spoofing:
Attackers forge the source IP address in packet headers to deceive the target about the origin of the communication.
ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Flood:
Overwhelms a network by sending a large volume of ICMP packets, disrupting normal communication.
Smurf Attack:
Exploits ICMP to flood a target network with traffic, often by sending ICMP echo requests to multiple hosts with a forged source IP.
Ping of Death:
Sends oversized ICMP packets, exploiting vulnerabilities in network protocols to crash or disrupt systems.
Land Attack:
Spoofs the source and destination addresses in TCP/IP packets to make a system respond to itself, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.
Layer 4 Attacks (Transport Layer):

SYN/ACK Flood (TCP Flood):
Overloads a server by sending a high volume of TCP SYN or ACK packets, exhausting resources and preventing legitimate connections.
UDP Flood:
Floods a target with a large volume of UDP (User Datagram Protocol) packets, overwhelming its ability to process them.
TCP/IP Fragmentation Attacks:
Exploits vulnerabilities in how systems handle fragmented packets, leading to system crashes or resource exhaustion.
TCP Reset (RST) Attack:
Forges TCP RST packets to terminate established connections, disrupting communication between two parties.
Session Hijacking (TCP Session Hijacking):
Involves intercepting and taking over an established TCP session between two parties, gaining unauthorized access.
DNS Amplification Attack:
Exploits open DNS resolvers to flood a target with DNS response traffic, causing a denial of service.
Understanding these attacks is crucial for implementing effective security measures, and AWS Shield Advanced, as mentioned earlier, is designed to mitigate the impact of various DDoS attacks, including those targeting Layer 3 and Layer 4.

Layer 7 attack for dos and list


ChatGPT
Layer 7 attacks, also known as application layer attacks, target the top layer of the OSI model, focusing on the application and user interface. These attacks often exploit vulnerabilities in the software or application itself. Here's a list of common Layer 7 attacks:

HTTP Flood:
Overwhelms a web server by sending a massive volume of HTTP requests, exhausting server resources and causing service disruption.
Slowloris Attack:
Exploits the way web servers handle simultaneous connections by sending HTTP headers at a slow rate, keeping connections open and exhausting resources.
SQL Injection:
Injects malicious SQL queries into input fields, exploiting vulnerabilities in a database-backed web application to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
Injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users

Don’t mention Waf, shield will take care Waf rules apart from ddos


ChatGPT
AWS Shield Advanced primarily focuses on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection, handling network and transport layer defenses. While it provides global threat environment awareness and adaptive security measures, it doesn't directly manage AWS WAF rules for specific web application vulnerabilities like XSS or SQL injection.

If you have set up AWS WAF with custom rules to address application-layer threats, AWS WAF will handle the enforcement of those rules independently. AWS Shield, in this scenario, complements the protection by focusing on DDoS mitigation.

In summary, for DDoS protection, AWS Shield Advanced plays a crucial role. For web application layer protection, AWS WAF is the dedicated service, and its rules are independently managed and enforced. The two services work together to offer a comprehensive security strategy, each addressing specific aspects of the overall threat landscape.
